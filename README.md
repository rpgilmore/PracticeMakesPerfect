# PracticeMakesPerfect
A place to store practice problems in various languages.

I am going to keep this repository organized by language, then within each language 
the sources of the problems, and finally the problems themselves. Since I'm currently working
on getting more familiar with progamming languages, this organization makes the most sense.

For instance
Python --> /Python_for_Biologists/
           /Adv_Python_for_Biologists/
           /Eff_Python_for_Biologists/
           
C --> /C_Prog_Lang_2e/
      /Proj_Euler/
